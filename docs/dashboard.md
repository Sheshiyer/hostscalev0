## Visual Effects System

### Glassmorphism Implementation
- **Base Effect**: Semi-transparent panels with backdrop blur
- **Depth Variations**: Different blur intensities for hierarchy
- **Edge Treatment**: Subtle light borders on top/left edges
- **Shadow Effects**: Soft shadows for elevation indication
- **Hover Enhancement**: Increased transparency and glow on interaction

### Animation Principles
- **Purpose-Driven**: All animations serve communication purpose
- **Timing Curves**: Custom easing functions for natural movement
- **Duration Guidelines**: 300-500ms for major transitions, 150-200ms for micro-interactions
- **Staggered Reveals**: Content elements appear in sequence rather than simultaneously
- **Spatial Continuity**: Elements maintain spatial relationships during transitions

### Lighting System
- **Ambient Illumination**: Subtle overall lighting effect
- **Focus Lighting**: Increased brightness for active elements
- **Directional Highlights**: Light reflections responding to interaction
- **State Indication**: Different lighting for various states (default, hover, active)
- **Attention Guidance**: Light leading user attention to important elements
