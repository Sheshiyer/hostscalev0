## The Challenge

Managing multiple short-term rental properties across different platforms creates exponential complexity:

```mermaid

    A[Multiple Airbnb Accounts] --> F[Operational Chaos]
    B[Repetitive Guest FAQs] --> F
    C[Manual Coordination] --> F
    D[Inconsistent Experience] --> F

    F --> G[Limited Growth]
    F --> H[Rising Costs]
